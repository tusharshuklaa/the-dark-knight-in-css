CSS Art | The Dark Knight | Batman | Pure CSS


## Overview
This project showcases an image of Batman created entirely using pure CSS. No images or external graphics are used; everything is crafted with CSS.

## File Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the Batman image.
- `styles/`: This folder contains all the CSS files used to style the Batman image.

### Styles Folder
The `styles` folder is particularly important as it contains a series of CSS files named incrementally (e.g., `01.css`, `02.css`, etc.). Each file represents an incremental change in the development of the CSS image. By following the sequence of these files, you can see the step-by-step progression and refinement of the Batman image. `1.css` contains the initial setup whereas `9.css` is the final code for the whole Batman CSS art. `10.css` has extra outlines around main parts of the image for understanding purpose only.
